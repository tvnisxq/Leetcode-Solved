            Brute Force Approach:
                â–· Time: O(nÂ²) -> quadratic relationship between input size and run time.
                                If input size doubles, run time quadruples. n is the length 
                                of the nums array. 
                â–· Space: O(n) -> uses a constant amount of auxiliary space, the space complexity is O(1).
                                It does not grow with input size n.
